App.jsx is your main application shell (where routes, providers, and layout go). Example: Vite + React 

🚀 As Your Project Grows...

When things scale even further (teams, business complexity, domains), you can transition to a feature-sliced or domain-driven structure:

src/
├── entities/      // business models like User, Post
├── features/      // login, comment, create post
├── shared/        // shared components, hooks, utils
├── widgets/       // composed UI units (e.g., Header, Sidebar)
├── pages/
├── processes/     // flows (e.g., sign-in flow)
